##### Mini I-Ching Edition, Possibly Smallest On Earth
---
*miniic* generates a printable duplex page of I Ching, the book of changes.

The edition includes the raw I Ching, for only _The Judgement_, _The Image_ and the _Moving Lines_. Interpretations are left to the oracle consultant.

**Live Demo** *Don't worry* if it looks _huge_ on screen. It is only meant to be printed:
[https://fde-capu.github.io/miniic/](https://fde-capu.github.io/miniic/)

Printing:

- Print front and back one at the time.
- You need the front and back cut marks aligned; this is tricky and depends on the system and printer.
- Remeber to set the maximum available quality.

Assembling:

- Sharply cut the pages by the cut marks.
- Set the pagination sequence in order. Take note the sheets will fold on each other.

Binding with staples\*:
- Take a loose paper staple and mark two positions, four points of puncture.
- Take a needle and pierce the sheets at the proper spots.
- Manually tit two paper staples facing the middle page through the holes and user your fingernails to close them.
- Use a stiletto to chop off the exceding page alignments.
\* You may wish instead to manually sew the pages.

Extras:

- Make a case, for example, take a good quality plastic bag, a double-sized adehesive tape and a hot knife to make a small impermeable case.
- Keep miniic in your wallet.
